Reagan DodgeAssignment 8  1.  Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain. Yes. This happens when values are outside the scope of reality. Our model is “too perfect”. 2.  In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships?  If so, do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with this in RYes some plots did. We can adjust for this by using polynomial regressions. This function adds polynomial or quadratic terms to our regression. These can help in choosing the best data set for analysis and graphs. http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/40-regression-analysis/162-nonlinear-regression-essentials-in-r-polynomial-and-spline-regression-models/
