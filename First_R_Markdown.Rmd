## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

This is the Iris data set. Our **favorite** ggplot. 

____

This is a list:

  * item 1
  * item 2
    + sub 
    + sub
    
    

```{r echo=FALSE}
#### three tick marks starts a line of code. then you select the language you want. 
library(ggplot2)
data("iris")
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y= Sepal.Width, color= Species))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
  summary(iris)
```

```{bash}
pwd
ls -1
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
